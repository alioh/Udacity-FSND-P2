# Project Two: Item Catalog
This is part of the Fullstack Nanodegree Udacity course. In this project, I was requested to make a full web application
to list Items within categories, and provide the user the ability to register and add, update and delete their catalog items.
Along with having the ability to use the api and receive json file with all their items.
